  Minecraft version of the Hunger Games. There are two available modes
  in which the plugin can run in:
    - Tournament Mode
    - Normal Mode
  When run in Tournament Mode, the game has to be started manually, the
  tablist will show points of every tributes. Points are behaving as the
  tournament mode document describes it. Normal mode on the other hand
  will look and feel like a usual Minigame.
